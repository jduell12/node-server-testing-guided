## Unit Testing

- function that has some arguments and will return a value
- test by invoking the function and putting in different values as args and checking the result you receive back from the function

## Front-End Testing

- test a component by putting in props and getting back a piece of UI
- check the UI received from component against what is expected back
  - need rendering framework to get UI and check

  - need framework to test the endpoint
    - server
